# Simple Architecture Framework

## Versioning

[Semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/lang/ru/spec/v2.0.0.html) is used for versioning.

Versioning is performed using:
* branch with name ``release/v{VERSION_NUMBER}``
  * for example, release/v1.0.0 или release/v2.3.4
* tag with name ``v{VERSION_NUMBER}``
  * for example, v1.0.0 или v2.3.4

## Translations

In order to maximize coverage, official translations into the following languages are being conducted:
* russian
* english (in planning)
* chinese (in planning)
